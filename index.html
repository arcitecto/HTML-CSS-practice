    <p>
        I'm a relatively simple man; Introverted, not much for talking but sociable when need be, I enjoy learning new
        things, particularly related to Science and Technology, Health and Fitness and Geopolitics.
    </p><br>
    <ul><strong><u>My <mark>goals</mark> during my enrollment in the RA program are:</u></strong>
        <li>Develop a strong foundational knowledge of the languages and tools necessary for the entire web-dev cycle.
        </li>
        <li>Create a portfolio of individual and team-built projects to showcase in my developer repositories for
            potential employers to view.</li>
        <li>Develop the intellectual discipline necessary for a for a long-standing career in an (at times) mentally
            taxing field like computer science.</li>
        <li>Maximize the learning curve afforded to me as a new developer using the experience of the program mentors
            and other students. </li>
        <li>Establish a personal and professional network of other developers both new and experienced with the mentors
            and other students in this cohort.</li>
    </ul>
